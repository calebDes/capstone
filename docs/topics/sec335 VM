The goal for this milestone would be to complete an exploit VM on the SHIRE network. 

I will be building a VM on the SHIRE subnet to be exploited by the eth hack wan. This will give me experiance mainly on finding, demonstrating, and creating vulnerable systems. 

Objectives
1.) gain access to the shire network/create VM on shire 
2.) find exploits/vulnerabilities I want to exploit
3.) build the vm with exploits that leads to a root compromise
