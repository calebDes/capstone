# capstone
I will be building A SIEM in the AWS cloud. This tool will be used for threat detection and incident management in the cloud. In the begining I plan on working with the software and getting an understanding for how it works and how I can configure it to impliment the things I want. Then In the fute I will apply it to a network and get it configured to protect that network.
