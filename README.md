sec335 pentesting VM
I would build a VM that has vulnrabilities that can be pen tested.
I found the class intresting and I would be intrested in building the VMs that would be attacked by futer students.
I don't know what exactly I would be doing yet I am assuming I would ask devin to see if he wanted anything inparticular before starting the project.

Risl assessment tool
I would build a tool that can scan over a network or software/firmware don't know which yet. The scan would output your vulrability level, and list out all potential volribilities that it picked up.
I think this would be intresting because I have never used a tool like this. I feel like it would be useful for seeing if you are vulnerable or not.
I plan on building a soft ware that will scan over information and test if it is secure or not.
